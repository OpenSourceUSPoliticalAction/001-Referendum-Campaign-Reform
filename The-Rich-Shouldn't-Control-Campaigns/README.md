## Supporting Information

We went with "individual entity" in case the *Only People Can Donate to Campaigns* amendment fails; however, workarounds of this amendment are certainly possible if that amendment fails. This is very open to improvement.

The actual number should be based on the U.S. census, as that is also defined by the Constitution and assumedly reliable. The derivation of that number of certainly open to improvement. Note that the current median annual income oftotal workers as of 2022 [according to the U.S. census](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2023/demo/p60-279.pdf) (page 8, figure 4) is $47,960. We chose total workers due to occupations like those found in the gig economy and considering those with multiple part-time jobs.

One consideration is the possibility of drastic inflation or deflation since the last census. Methods of accounting for that are certainly welcome.
