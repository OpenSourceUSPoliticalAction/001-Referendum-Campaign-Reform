# Campaigns Should Be Short

## The Amendment Text

### Section 1

Campaigns for the office of U.S. President cannot begin more than 60 days before the selection of states' electors. A campaign includes advertisements and public gatherings by a candidate's supporters or critics.

### Section 2

Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.


## Supporting Information

This needs improvement. What about third parties analyzing potential candidates' viability? What about speculation of who many run in the future? Should these be allowed? If so, how do we allow these while keeping the language simple?

This is intended to force candidates to be efficient in their campaigns and improve focus of candidates' platforms. The expected benefit is to increase focus on relevant issues, reduce the vitriol between candidates by limiting opportunities for attacks, and reduce political fatigue on U.S. citizens.

The 60 days number is based on cursory readings about other countries' elections and consideration of current U.S. elections. This is certainly open for debate.
