# Only People Can Donate to Campaigns

## The Amendment Text

Only individual humans can donate money, goods, or labor towards presidential candidates' campaigns for the office of U.S. President. The Presidential Election Campaign Fund may match individual humans' contributions.

## Supporting Information

This amendment is intended to permanently reverse the Supreme Court decision in *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*. It is meant to eliminate the ability for corporate interests to influence presidential elections by donating money or providing free services (goods or labor). Specifying money essentially eliminates Political Action Committees. Specifying goods or labor prevents corporate interests from providing "favors" to candidates, such as free advertisements or campaign materials. Specifying the office of the U.S. President prevents arguments against this amendment over-reaching and affecting elections for other offices.

The second sentence allows the continuation of the U.S. Treasury's Presidential Election Campaign Fund.
