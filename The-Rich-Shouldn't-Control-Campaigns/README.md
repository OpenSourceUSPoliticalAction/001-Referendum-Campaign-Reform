# The Rich Shouldn't Control Campaigns

## The Amendment Text

The total donations from an individual entity towards a Presidential candidate cannot be more than one-tenth of the median annual income of a U.S. citizen as found in the most recent U.S. census.

## Supporting Information

We went with "individual entity" in case the *Only People Can Donate to Campaigns* amendment fails; however, workarounds of this amendment are certainly possible if that amendment fails. This is very open to improvement.

The actual number should be based on the U.S. census, as that is also defined by the Constitution and assumedly reliable. The derivation of that number of certainly open to improvement.

One consideration is the possibility of drastic inflation or deflation since the last census. Methods of accounting for that are certainly welcome.
