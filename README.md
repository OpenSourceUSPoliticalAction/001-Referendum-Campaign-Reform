# Presidential Campaign Reform

This is the workspace to draft a constitutional amendment for presidential campaign reform.

## The Proposed Amendments

The below-linked amendments are meant to be as plain-English as possible for the average U.S. voter to understand while being legally robust. However, politicians and lobbyists are clever, so they should undergo the most intense scrutiny as possible by scholars and lawyers. We should also ensure that people skilled in public influence also review to ensure the fewest things possible could be misconstrued or twisted against the effort.

2. [Campaigns Should Be Short](Campaigns-Should-Be-Short/README.md)
3. [The Rich Shouldn't Control Campains](The-Rich-Shouldn't-Control-Campaigns/README.md)

Note that these amendments are intentionally separated. They should be as short as possible. Each amendment should be beneficial on its own, though the best results would be the ratification of all three.

## Method of Amendment

The currently target method of amendment is constitutional convention, where according to Article V of the U.S. Constitution the states:

> shall propose amendments to this Constitution, ... on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, ...  shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof,

 Two put in simpler, modern English: two-thirds of state legislatures would call for a convention of states to vote on the amendment, where three-fourths of the states' votes would be required for the amendment to be passed. It is worth noting that none of the current U.S. Constitutional amendments have been passed by constitutional convention. All 27 amendments have been passed by a two-thirds majority of the House of Representatives and the Senate.

This targeted method is open for debate. The assumption is that congressional representatives would be opposed to this reform, as they are subject to a similar level of influence as presidential candidates. State legislatures tend to have less scrutiny from larger political influences and are more likely to not be interfered with by larger lobbying organizations, at least until the constitutional convention. If the constitutional convention were to pass, enough scrunity from U.S. citizens may be enough to mitigate the impact of larger lobbying organizations.

## How to Participate

First, you'll need to make an account on [Github](https://github.com/). While we'd prefer this not be tied to a corporate product, the Git technology allows everyone to maintain their own copy if desired. If Github does anything shady, it would be trivial to setup elsewhere.

Visit [the repository for these amendments](https://github.com/OpenSourceUSPoliticalAction/Presidential-Campaign-Reform).

### I Want to Discuss Something

At the top of the amendment repository page, click [the "Issues" tab or here](https://github.com/OpenSourceUSPoliticalAction/Presidential-Campaign-Reform/issues). Look through existing issues to determine if the discussion is already ongoing. If not, click [the "New issue" button or here](https://github.com/OpenSourceUSPoliticalAction/Presidential-Campaign-Reform/issues/new).

### I Want to Propose a Change

At the top right of the amendment repository page, click [the "Fork" button or here](https://github.com/OpenSourceUSPoliticalAction/Presidential-Campaign-Reform/fork). This will create a copy of the repository in your own account. There, you can navigate around each file and click the edit icon (it looks like a pencil) to make whatever ends you like. Once you're happy with your changes, you can [create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). See the linked documentation for how. Once you've created the pull request, you can visit the page for the pull request for discussion and updates. If the maintainers of the project agree with your pull request, they'll merge your changes into the current version of the repository.
